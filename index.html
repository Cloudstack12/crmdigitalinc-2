                    <br>
                    <p><b>Install Tracking Code:</b> Once you have created an account, you must install the tracking code on your website. This code enables the tool to track visitor behavior and gather data about your website's performance. The installation process may vary depending on your device, but most tools provide detailed instructions on installing the tracking code.</p>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    <p><b>Configure Filters:</b> Filters enable you to exclude certain types of traffic from your website analytics, such as internal traffic or spam. Configuring filters ensures that your data is accurate and relevant.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Customize Reports:</b> Most website traffic analytics tools provide standard reports that offer insights into traffic sources, user behavior, and conversion rates. However, you can also customize notifications to focus on specific metrics or segments of your audience.</p>
